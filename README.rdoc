Code Name: Adjutant is a simple Web application built using Ruby on Rails that will allow vendors to manage clients and projects by tracking documents, expenses and billable hours in one location. It will also allow the vendor to generate and track invoices and will have the option of allowing clients to view billable hours and expenses trackers.

This is my first Rails app and I am building it to help learn the framework. It is not currently functional, but this README will contain all documntation on the app as it is completed as well as instructions on use.
